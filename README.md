# BattleShip
This is my implementation of a battleship game. It can play human v. human, human v. AI, and AI v. AI. This was created for a competition in CS255 Intro to Artificial Intelligence at Saint Vincent College, in which it won first place. The main strategies used in the project are a computationally inexpensive heatmap, strafing, sweep then destroy, and clustering detection.
