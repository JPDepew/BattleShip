1. Start by firing at the middle 5 x 5 square
2. fire only at even or odd squares (parity)
3. Heat-map 
4. Assign a value to each square or just attack squares around hits
5. Is it better to destroy a ship as soon as you find it, or keep an index of that location and keep searching for other ships?
6. (Possible) When you have hit a ship, instead of immediately circling it, attack 2 to the right, 2 to the left, 2 up, and 2 down. This way your
shots are still only even or odd, which means missed shots are not wasted. However, this should only be done if the correct number or ships are left.
7. (Possible) This could be similar to a heat map. The AI could divide the board into 4 quadrants and see which has the most open spots. It would then take a random shot
at the quadrant with the most open spots. This is essentially saying that a more open quadrant is more likely to have a ship. This would only be useful later in the game.

Setup:
1. 2 spaces between each ship
2. It's more strategic to avoid sides, but they may expect us to do that,
so we could potentially screw with their AI.
