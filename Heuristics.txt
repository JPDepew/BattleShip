1. Start by firing at the middle 5 x 5 square
2. fire only at even or odd squares (parity)
3. Heat-map 
4. Assign a value to each square or just attack squares around hits
5. Is it better to destroy a ship as soon as you find it, or keep an index of that location and keep searching for other ships?

Setup:
1. 2 spaces between each ship
2. It's more strategic to avoid sides, but they may expect us to do that,
so we could potentially screw with their AI.
